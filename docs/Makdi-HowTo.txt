

Prerequisites
=============
1.Makdi requires JDK 1.5 or higher
2. Make sure Java is in system PATH

Open a command prompt
Type
java -version

on command line. you should get version 1.5 or higher.


Unpacking
==========
1. Unzip content of makdi distribution in a folder
2. cd to this folder
Now this folder structure is like:
<unzip-folder>
 |_ dist\
 |_ dist\lib\
 |_ test.keywords
 |_ all-profile.xml

Make sure you have this structure

dist\lib\ contains the libraries used by makdi spider


Running makdi
=================

cd to above folder and type

/> java -jar dist\makdi.jar 

This will print usage

Usage: java -jar makdi.jar [options] ...
 where options are
 -k, --keywords          a file containing source keywords
 -a, --action    select action, one of [test|store|generate]
         action: generate        generate html pages from DB
         action: store   store results in db
         action: test    generate test html pages
 -p, --profile   profile.xml containg drivers and meta information


Makdi needs a keywords file to process (obviously!) , one profle file (that tells it what drivers to load)
and an action. Like for beginners you can test your installation by typing in something like

/>java -jar .\dist\makdi.jar  -k <keywords file> -a test -p <profile file>

where keywords file is your keyword file name and profile file is your profile file name.

/>java -jar .\dist\makdi.jar  -k test.keywords -a test -p my-profile.xml

keywords are created one on a line, see sample test.keywords file for example.
profile file contains information on what drivers to load and what transformations should be done on keywords.

Ruuning your profile file
===========================
To start exploration of web with makdi, you can make a copy of all-profile.xml file. Remember this is just to get you started 
and you have to tune your profile file according to your needs.

/> copy all-profile.xml my-profile.xml
/>java -jar .\dist\makdi.jar  -k test.keywords -a test -p my-profile.xml



Anatomy of profile file
==========================
Profile file has information on drivers and their transformers. By default all drivers need a transformer. 
If you do not want to process your keywords in any way, please use an empty transformer element, like
<trandformer/>

You can also supply suffix and prefix with transformers.
A) Prefix only

<transformer>
  <prefix>title: </prefix> 
  </transformer>

B) suffix only
<transformer>
  <suffix>trailer</suffix> 
  </transformer>

C) Prefix and suffix both 

<transformer>
  <prefix>title: </prefix> 
  <suffix>trailer</suffix> 
  </transformer>


1)
Google CSE driver : searchId is google custom search Id for your site and this will vary from site to site.

2) RSS driver : external source (full URL)

<webgloo.makdi.drivers.RssDriver>
  <feedURI>http://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml</feedURI> 
  <maxResults>10</maxResults> 
  <source>0</source> 
  <transformer /> 
  <isExternal>true</isExternal> 
  </webgloo.makdi.drivers.RssDriver>

RSS driver : use our tags, internal sources

<webgloo.makdi.drivers.RssDriver>
  <maxResults>5</maxResults> 
  <source>1</source> 
  <transformer /> 
  <isExternal>false</isExternal> 
  </webgloo.makdi.drivers.RssDriver>

where internal sources are 

1 - Google News


3) YAHOO BOSS driver (search in Yahoo web) - siteNames are mandatory

<webgloo.makdi.drivers.YahooBossDriver>
  <maxResults>2</maxResults> 
 <siteNames>
  <string>rottentomatoes.com</string> 
  <string>flickr.com</string> 
  </siteNames>
 <transformer>
  <prefix>intitle:</prefix> 
  <suffix>+book</suffix> 
  </transformer>
  </webgloo.makdi.drivers.YahooBossDriver>

 

Results
=========

All results are stored in makdi-output folder.
For test runs, the results are stored in makdi-output\test.com folder
HTML is created according to driver order listed in profile xml file.
You can repeat drivers in any manner in profile xml file (even duplicates are fine..)


ENJOY!
